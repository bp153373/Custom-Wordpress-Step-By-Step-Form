<b>How to install</b>
1. Download the .zip and open the files in a code editor.
2. Go to your wp-admin and find and click Contact > Add New. Give the new Form a Title to your liking.
3. Copy and paste all the code from 'index.html' and paste it into 'Form'.
4. Find and click 'E-mail' (next to 'Form') and make it look something like this: <img src="https://gyazo.com/52bf86782f662f5136e097e195955588.png" alt="example">
5. Save it!
6. Go, in your wp-admin, to your advanced options where you can add custom CSS and custom scripts (for me this was Flatsome > Advanced).
7. Copy and paste the CSS from the 'style.css' file into the 'Custom CSS' area. (for me this was Flatsome > Advanced > Custom CSS > All Screens)
8. Copy and paste everything from 'script.js' into the custom script area (footer script). (for me this was Flatsome > Advanced > Global Settings > Footer Scripts)
9. Save All Changes!
10. Place the form on your Page.

<b>Notes:</b>
1. You can customize to your liking in the Custom CSS. 
2. Add 'class:required' to the shortcode of the inputs, which are required, in the contact form.
3. Requirement is being checked in the script if it's empty, the value type remains unchecked.
4. Free for use and customization.

UPDATE:
 - Added CSS for responsiveness
